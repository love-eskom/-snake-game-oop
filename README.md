# 🐍 Snake Game - OOP Version

A modern, object-oriented Python version of the classic Snake game, developed using the **Turtle Graphics** library.

---

## 📦 Features

- **OOP Structure:** Clean and modular code with `Snake`, `Food`, and `ScoreBoard` classes
- **Bonus Food Logic:** Red food items randomly appear and reward extra points
- **High Score Tracking:** High scores are saved to a file (`score_data.txt`) and loaded at start
- **Improved Collision Logic:** Smooth animation and accurate boundary detection

## 📁 File Structure

```bash
snake-game-oop/
├── food.py             # Handles food generation and bonus logic
├── main.py             # Game loop and screen setup
├── score_board.py      # Score tracking and high score saving
├── snake_data.py       # Snake movement and control
├── score_data.txt      # Stores high score persistently
├── updates.txt         # Report & future improvement notes
└── README.md           # This file
```

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```
Make sure you have Python installed (Turtle comes built-in with most Python versions).

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- Python OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- File I/O (reading/writing high scores)
- Event-driven programming
- Use of the Turtle graphics library

---

## 🛠 Enhancements

- 📈 High score persistence
- 🎯 Bonus food with random score rewards
- 🧼 Bug fixes for smoother segment animation
- 🧠 Cleaner logic for movement and body collision

---

## 🎯 Future Improvements

- Speed increases with difficulty
- Add sound effects using `winsound` (Windows) or `pygame`
- Game restart functionality
- GUI integration (Tkinter)
